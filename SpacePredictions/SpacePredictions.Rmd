# Preamble

Moran's eigenvector maps [@dray_spatial_2006] are used to represent spatial
variation in models. It achieves this by providing sets of orthogonal variables
generated from the pairwise distances among the sampling sites. The latter are
calculated from geodesic or Cartesian (i.e., projected) site coordinates.
Moran's eigenvector maps gets their names from the Moran's index, as their is
a simple correspondence between the eigenvalues associated with each spatial
eigenvector and the Moran index calculated on that spatial eigenvector.


Moran's eigenvector maps calculation as defined in @dray_spatial_2006 proceeds
from a binary matrix of connectivity among locations $\mathbf{B} = [b_{i,j}]$,
which can be obtained from a matrix of pairwise distances among locations
($\mathbf{D} = [d_{i,j}]$, e.g., a Cartesian or geodesic two-dimensional space,
a three-dimensional Euclidean space, a one-dimensional transect) or a list of
edges from a connectivity graph, such as that resulting, for instances, from a
Delauney triangulation or a minimum spanning tree. The distance matrix is
transformed into a matrix of edge weights $\mathbf{W} = [w_{i,j}]$ using a
distance-weighting function. Matrices $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{W}$ are then
Haddamar-multiplied, resulting in a weighted connectivity matrix. This matrix
is row- and column-centred to a value of $0$ and submitted to eigenvalue
decomposition. By virtue of the centring to $0$, the centred weighted
connectivity matrix has a rank of at most $n - 1$, where $n$ is the number of
different locations, and thus at most $n - 1$ non-zero eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. The whole process can be written as follows:

$$
\mathbf{Q} \{\mathbf{B} * \mathbf{W}\} \mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{U}\mathbf{D}_\lambda\mathbf{U}^\mathsf{T},
$$

where $\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{I}_{n} - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n}$ is the idempotent centring matrix of
dimension $n \times n$, $*$ denoted the Haddamar (element-wise) product of the
matrices, $\mathbf{U}$ is a matrix of eigenvectors (dimensions:
$n \times k \leq (n - 1)$) and $\mathbf{D}_\lambda$ is a diagonal matrix of
(non-zero) eigenvalues. Following Dray... there is an algebraic equivalence
between these eigenvalues and the Moran's index ($I$) of their corresponding
eigenvectors, had $\mathbf{B}*\mathbf{W}$ been used as the spatial weights
matrix during the index calculation. Assuming the values of the diagonal of
$\mathbf{B}*\mathbf{W}$ to be $0$s equivalence is as follows:

$$
I_{\lambda_k} = n \frac{\lambda_k}{\sum_{\forall i,j}b_{i,j}w_{i,j}},
$$

Three distance weighting functions have been proposed by @dray_spatial_2006

## Making predictions

### Continuous spatial operator

In this paper, we are interested in the behaviour of Moran's in between the
sampling locations, in order to assess their potential as bases for spatial
interpolation. For interpolation, we expected that the smoothness of the spatial
operator to be consequential to the smoothness of the resulting spatial
eigenfunctions, thereby impacting their adequacy for representing continuous
spatial phenomenons. For simplification sake, we will restrict the definition of
connectivity to be strictly distance-based and thus disregard graph-based
definitions. This simplification enables us to formalize both the connectivity
ans spatial weighting into single equations as follows:

$$
w_i =
  \begin{cases}
    d \leq d_{max}, 1-\frac{d_i}{d_{max}} \\
    d > d_{max}, 0 \\
  \end{cases}
$$

for the linear weighting function,

$$
w_i =
  \begin{cases}
    d \leq d_{max}, 1-\left(\frac{d_i}{d_{max}}\right)^\alpha \\
    d > d_{max}, 0 \\
  \end{cases}
$$

for the concave up function, and

$$
w_i =
  \begin{cases}
    d \leq d_{max}, \frac{1}{(1 + d_i)^\alpha} \\
    d > d_{max}, 0 \\
  \end{cases}
$$

for the concave down function. Notice that the latter had to be altered from the
original proposition by @dray_spatial_2006 in order to become continuous at
$d_{i,j} = 0$. These functions take the values $0$ for distances above
$d_{max}$, thereby involving thresholding in an implicit, distance-based,
manner and disregard $\mathbf{B}$, since $\mathbf{W}$ now comes with an implicit
threshold $d \leq d_{max}$. On the other hand, this definition implies that the
value $1$ is consistently found on the diagonal of $\mathbf{W}$, which alter the
equivalence between the eigenvector and eigenvector's associated Moran's index
as follows:

$$
I_{\lambda_k} = n \frac{\lambda_k - 1}{\sum_{\forall i,j} w_{i,j}},
$$

Therefore, using a continuous spatial operator has very little impact in the
interpretability of the eigenvectors with respect to the Moran's index.

### Calculating eigenfunction values between the locations

One can represent the spatial eigenvectors from the centred weights matrix by
performing a simple algebraic reorganization of the eigensystem equation
presented earlier as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\left(\mathbf{I}_n - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n}\right) \mathbf{W} \left(\mathbf{I}_n - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n}\right) &= \mathbf{U} \mathbf{D}_\lambda \mathbf{U}^\mathsf{T} \\
\mathbf{I}_n \mathbf{W} \mathbf{I}_n - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{I}_n \mathbf{W} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n} - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n} \mathbf{W} \mathbf{I}_n + \frac{1}{n^2} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n} \mathbf{W} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n}  &= \mathbf{U}\mathbf{D}_\lambda \mathbf{U}^\mathsf{T} \\
\mathbf{W} - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{W} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n} - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n} \mathbf{W} + \frac{1}{n^2} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n} \mathbf{W} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n}  &= \mathbf{U}\mathbf{D}_\lambda \mathbf{U}^\mathsf{T} \\
\left( \mathbf{W} - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{W} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n} - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n} \mathbf{W} + \frac{1}{n^2} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n} \mathbf{W} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n}  \right) \mathbf{U} \mathbf{D}_{\lambda^{-1}} &= \mathbf{U} \\
\end{align*}
$$

Let $\mathbf{W}^*$ be the weight matrix calculated for $m$ new locations using
the same weighting function as for $\mathbf{W}$ and the distances between the
new locations and the original ones found in $\mathbf{W}$ (hence, the dimensions
of $\mathbf{W}^*$ are $m \times n$). The values of these new locations on the
spatial eigenfunctions defined previously are obtained as follows:

$$
\mathbf{U}^* = \left( \mathbf{W}^* - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{W}^* \mathbf{1}_{n \times n} - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}_{m \times n} \mathbf{W} + \frac{1}{n^2} \mathbf{1}_{m \times n} \mathbf{W} \mathbf{1}_{n \times n}  \right) \mathbf{U} \mathbf{D}_{\lambda^{-1}},
$$

where the matrix of spatial eigenfunction values $\mathbf{U}^*$ has dimensions
$m \times k$, with $k$ being the number of non-zero eigenvalues in the
eigensystem. Using that approach, it is possible to calculate the values of the
spatial eigenfunctions for out-of-sample locations, and thus perform spatial
interpolation. However, we have yet to provide an assessment of the adequacy of
existing MEM distance weighting functions for such a purpose.
